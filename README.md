# Client_Care_Advisor_Simulation_By-Anshu_Gupta
A customer called in upset after noticing two charges for the same online payment. She was worried about a potential fraud or system error and wanted immediate clarification.

Section 2: My 3-Step Approach to Resolution

✅ Step 1: Listen & Empathize
I acknowledged the client’s concern, reassured her that I would stay on the line and help resolve the issue, and gathered relevant details (transaction date, amount, and method of payment).

✅ Step 2: Investigate & Confirm
I reviewed the transaction records in our CRM and bank system. I discovered that the second charge was a pending authorization, which would drop off within 24–48 hours. I confirmed this with internal policy documentation before responding.

✅Step 3: Explain & Resolve
I explained the difference between posted and pending charges, reassured the client that no money had been withdrawn twice, and sent a follow-up email summarizing the explanation for her records. I also flagged the account for monitoring as a proactive measure.

Section 3: Customer Outcome
The client felt heard, informed, and reassured. She appreciated the proactive follow-up and said she felt “more confident banking with us.” The issue was fully resolved within the call.

 Section 4: What This Shows
This is your self-reflection:

This scenario highlights my ability to stay calm under pressure, interpret policy and system data clearly, and prioritize the client’s trust. These are the same skills I developed while resolving 200+ customer issues per week at H&M.
